Current progress:
* Starting `colors` mode -- see comments for intended functionality. Figure color sequencing by swapping colors around, starting from the work in colors.py.
* Use this to figure out how to name the colors and which ones to use for my scale coloring. I'm thinking something like Red1..RedN where the lower number is purer, but I'm not sure. There are also a lot of shades. It's hard to know what makes sense.

After this is working, additional tasks, in undefined order, are:
* Get the web UI up
* Build the whole pitch/scale/layout engine
* Do the actual csound integration
