Next tasks, in undefined order, are:
* Build the whole pitch/scale/layout engine
* Update play_midi to send a note just based on scale degree: 60 ± steps from middle C. This should work with Scala files loaded into Surge-XT. See comments in midi_player.rs
* Do the actual csound integration
* Get the web UI up
