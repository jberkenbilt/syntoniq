This part of the manual discusses the Syntoniq keyboard. You can read a [quick overview](../introduction/keyboard/) in the manual's introduction section. In the upcoming chapters, we'll discuss the keyboard in depth.

The Syntoniq Keyboard application is separate from the Syntoniq language compiler, but the two work together. The keyboard application's configuration is a Syntoniq score file. You can maintain separate keyboard configurations, or you can add your own layouts for custom scales you might use in your arrangements and compositions. In addition to playing sounds, the keyboard application writes information to the console that you can use to help you notate music using the Syntoniq language. The keyboard is intended to be more of a *study keyboard* than a performance keyboard, but you can use it as a performance keyboard as well. This is discussed in subsequent chapters. (Author's note: I originally conceived of this application as a tool to help me with my own transcribing and arranging hobby; I like to transcribe music by ear, and this tool enables me to extend that practice to microtonal music!)

FUTURE: Update when the interactive chord builder is completed.

At this time, the syntoniq keyboard application only works with a narrow range of hardware, as discussed in subsequent sections. An item early on the roadmap is to create a text-based application for building chords interactively. This would leverage the Csound/MIDI output capabilities of the keyboard without requiring an input device.

The manual is interspersed with videos, which are hosted in the [Syntoniq YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@syntoniq). All contain narrative that was read verbatim from a script. You can find the [video scripts](../video-scripts/) at the end of the manual.
