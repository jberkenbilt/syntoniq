* Draw attention to the similarity in UI: both do some form of "move the first thing to the second thing"
* Use shift to shift the layout (moves the first note to the second note's position)
* Show shift as modifier and also as modal; also cancel in-flight
* Do the same with transpose (assigns the first note's pitch to the second note; point out direct mapping to the syntoniq language's `transpose` directive)
* Show octave transpose
* Use octave transpose while holding notes in sustain and not
* Do transpose across layouts
