All the videos in the manual contain narratives that were read verbatim from scripts. The text of the videos is included here for reference and are linked from the relevant sections of the documentation. Please note that the text is written to be read aloud, so you will see phrases like "Launchpad Mark 3" instead of "Launchpad MK3". Material in [square brackets] is a note to the reader.
