This is the manual for [Syntoniq](https://github.com/jberkenbilt/syntoniq). Syntoniq converts musical notation in text files to CSound or MIDI output. It was designed from the beginning to represent music in any tuning system, which makes it ideal for use with microtonal music. Syntoniq can generate MIDI using MTS (Midi Tuning System) with custom tunings and also MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) with pitch-bend, specifically designed to be friendly to import into a Digital Audio Workstation for further refinement.

# How to Read This Manual

The manual is divided into multiple parts. Parts are denoted by *part chapters* whose titles are ALL UPPERCASE. Later sections of the manual build upon earlier sections. Not all parts of the manual will matter to all people. When browsing the docs, be sure to read the part chapter for that part.
