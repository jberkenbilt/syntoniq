The name Syntoniq is significant in multiple ways, some directly personal.

# Musical Reasons

The most important origin is from the *syntonic comma*. This has the ratio 81/80 and is the difference between the major third you get by stacking four perfect fifths and the one you get from a perfect 5/4 ratio: $\frac{3}{2}^4 = \frac{81}{16}$, which when normalized to within an octave is $\frac{81}{64}$. This is also $\frac{9}{8}^2$, which is two of the "whole step" interval between `C` and `D` in a typical just intonation scale. It is represented by `I` in the Syntoniq [generated scale](../../microtonality/generated-scales/) system. A perfect major third has the ratio $\frac{5}{4} = \frac{80}{64}$. The interval between these is $\frac{81}{80}$, the Syntonic comma. This interval appears everywhere in just intonation. For example, a perfect fifth above a whole tone is $\frac{9}{8}\times\frac{3}{2} = \frac{27}{16}$. This is a *Pythagorean major sixth*, and is the one you get by normalizing three perfect fifths to within an octave. The usual 5-limit major sixth above the tonic is $\frac{5}{3}$, which is the $\frac{6}{5}$ minor third below the octave. Notice that $\frac{5}{3} = \frac{25}{15}$, which is close to $\frac{27}{16}$. How close? $\frac{5}{3} \div \frac{27}{16} = \frac{80}{81}$! Yet another way to get this interval is to go up in pitch by the $\frac{9}{8}$ whole tone, and then to go *down* in pitch by the *other* common whole tone in 5-limit just intonation, $\frac{10}{9}$ (the interval between `D` and `E` with conventional note names). This gives you $\frac{9}{8} \div \frac{10}{9} = \frac{81}{80}$. A particularly interesting thing about this is that you can spell this using the generated scale notation as `jI` (just intonation)! I actually noticed this long after I had picked the name Syntoniq.

# Etymological Reasons

The American Heritage Dictionary defines syntonic as "characterized by a high degree of emotional responsiveness to the environment." I believe this is what microtonal music is all about. Pure, just intonation ratios appear in nature, and the sonic world around us contains lots of pitches beyond the 12-tone equal-tempered scale. Once you start opening your ears to microtonality, you can start hearing all sorts of new sounds around you. As a personal note, my journey into microtonality has definitely increased my emotional responsiveness to the environment!

# Personal Reasons

I have always liked the letter `Q`, probably because it's the least common letter in the English language. I use that letter in nearly all my open source software. It's interesting that `Q` represents the ratio 17/16 in the Syntoniq generated scale system. This is the first step in the harmonic sequence above the fourth octave.

The name that I go by, "Jay", is spelled by the 10th, 1st, and 25th letters of the alphabet, respectively. If you concatenate these, you get `10125`. I have had this number floating around in my head since childhood. Long after I picked the name Syntoniq, I noticed that $\frac{81}{80} = 1.0125$. If this isn't a whisper from the universe, I'm not sure what is!
