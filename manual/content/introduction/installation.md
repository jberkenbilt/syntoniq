Gemini:

* Download and Install
* Audio Smoke Test (verify sound generation)
* Build from source including disabling csound feature and how build.rs works

Installation -- download and install + smoke test: make sure you can hear sounds so you know the tool is working

TODO: best way to distribute this beyond making the user run `cargo install`.
