# To-do List

Work in things from docs/scratch

## Software

* Create a `demo` mode. Embed examples/microtonal-hello.stq. Generate the stq, csound, mpe MIDI, and mts MIDI files, and suggest ways to play them back.

## Documentation

* Pay special attention to "on active" or "on octave" instead of "an octave" and "ration" instead of "ratio"
* Find all occurrences of `TODO` in the docs.
* Tweak theme for better colors
* Remember not to use "DSL" in the docs.
* Figure out where to document the stuff in misc

## Release

* Use cargo-dist for creating distributions.
